### Visualising the results of PPO agents compared to TRPO and A2C methods.

Training of PPO, TRPO, A2C reinforcment learning algorithms using [StableBaselines3](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstable-baselines3.readthedocs.io%2Fen%2Fmaster%2F) and [RL Baselines3 Zoo](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frl-baselines3-zoo.readthedocs.io%2Fen%2Fmaster%2F). </br>

To replicate:
1. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Open [rlzoo_compare.ipynb](rlzoo_compare.ipynb) and follow the notebook.
